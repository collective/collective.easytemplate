        Introduction
        ------------
        
        collective.easytemplate is targetted for the end users who need automatic text snippets in their Kupu content.
        collective.easytemplate allows safe template tags inside Kupu editable text or any user editable HTML.
        This enables automatic content generation inside HTML pages.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Plone lacks out of the box support to custom tags for content editors to play with.
        
        Use cases
        ---------
        
        Possible use cases are:
        
        * Folder list snippets on a page
        
        * Dynamic images
        
        * Generated tables
        
        Example
        -------
        
        Kupu editor text::
        
        Hello user!
        
        Please select one course from below:
        
        $folder_list("/courses/marketing")
        
        will result to the output::
        
        Hello user!
        
        Please select one course from below:
        
        * Marketing
        
        * Management
        
        * Plone development
        
        Status
        ------
        
        The current version (0.1) is still in development and has few issues.
        
        * Zope security is not respected. You must trust your content editors, since
        Cheetah bypasses security and malicious Python sawy user could seriously
        harm your site. For this reason, you can suggest any working Zope-aware
        non-XML-based template language for me.
        
        * Cheetah namespace traverse does not work. E.g. $myobject.myvar raises
        NotFound exception even if it is not present.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Add to your buildout::
        
        eggs =
        Cheetah
        collective.easytemplate
        
        zcml =
        collective.easytemplate
        
        Run quick installer for *Easy Template* product.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Use content type "Templated Document" whenever you want to use template tags in Kupu content.
        
        Available tags
        --------------
        
        Currently there isn't much you can do with the product out-of-the-box, but I accept
        all tag contributions. Most tags are site specific, so I trust the site developers
        extending this product for their own needs.
        
        Supported tags (version 0.1):
        
        * *$list_folder*($folder, $title, $filters)*
        
        portal_catalog based folder item listing with optional filter arguments.
        User inactive content access permission is respected (anonymous users
        don't see non-public content).
        
        *folder*: portal root, slash separated, relative path to the folder. No prefixing slash.
        
        *title*: Print this <h3> heading if the folder contains any items
        
        *filters* : Python dictionary of optional filters
        
        List all documents in folder yoursite/testfol and print title if there are any present::
        
        $list_folder($folder="testfol", $title="Test folder items", $filters={ "portal_type" : "Document"} )
        
        List all portal root items::
        
        $list_folder($folder="")
        
        * *portal_url*
        
        Print portal absolute URL. Useful for links.
        
        Register tags
        -------------
        
        If you want to add your own tags they must be added to Cheetah template namespace::
        
        from collective.easytemplate import tagconfig
        
        def mytagfunc():
        return "Foobar when the page is viewed"
        
        tagconfig["mytag"] = mytagfunc
        
        See TemplatedDocument.py for hacks regarding security and namespace's availability in the functions.
        
        Backend
        -------
        
        Cheetah template engine is used. Plone's native TAL does not work too well with escaped HTML.
        
        Sponsorship
        ------------
        
        The development of this product was sponsored by `London School of Marketing <http://londonschoolofmarketing.com>`_.
